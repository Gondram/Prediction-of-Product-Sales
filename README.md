# Big Mart Sales Prediction of Product Sales

Introduction | <p></p>

 An initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on the Big Mart Sales dataset with the ultimate objective of predicting product sales. The data encompasses information about various products across different outlets. I am in the process of assessing this to unveil patterns, trends, and potential insights. Preliminary steps included data cleansing, handling missing values and outliers, to ensure the reliability of subsequent analyses. | ![big_mart](https://github.com/Gondram/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/8175014/26d0596f-7305-4808-861a-373125ed5f62)

As we are looking at this from a sales prediciton perspective Outlet_Establishment_Year and Item_Weight's moderate correlation does not seem relevant.  However Item_MRP and Item_Outlet_Sales also have a moderate correlation. Being tied to sales this seems worth further investigation.
On the Item_Visibility Boxplot the mean is higher than the median. This is likely related to the fact that nothing has lower than 0% visibility, but there are outliers that are visible over 30% of the time.   | ![item_visibility_hist](https://github.com/Gondram/Prediction-of-Product-Sales/assets/8175014/68852655-7b6d-4994-a929-6a433b9ab844)
